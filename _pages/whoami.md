**Name**: [Akshunna S. Dogra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TL86PJMAAAAJ), **Email**: [adogra@nyu.edu](mailto:adogra@nyu.edu)  
**Links**: [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/a/dogra_a_1), [Git](https://github.com/MathePhysics), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TL86PJMAAAAJ), [Orcid](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1326-8976)

**Position**: President's Scholar, Dept. of Mathematics, Imperial College London **Also**: Group Leader, [Mathephysics](https://github.com/MathePhysics)

**Fields of interest**: Applied Mathematics, Dynamical Systems Theory, Information Theory, Machine Learning, Mathematical Physics

**Research Philosophy**: I am a model maker looking for good problems and people. If you/I have a good idea/question/answer, let's make it better together. **Also**: Everything is a dynamical system if you are brave enough.

**Favorite Mathematics book**: *Proofs from the Book*, by M. Aigner, G. M. Ziegler  
**Favorite Physics book**: *Classical Theory of Fields*, L. D. Landau, E. M. Lifshitz

**Favorite historical figure**: Evariste Galois (revolutionized mathematics, fomented a revolution, and died stupidly for love in a duel before age 21). I don't advise emulating all his actions. But do try to cram as much life into your years as he did.

**An interesting, non-academia fact about me**: I own/co-designed/co-manage a subsistence farming operation (we produce the best ghee on the planet).
