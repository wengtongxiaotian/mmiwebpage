I am the leader/founder of the loosely organized research group [_Mathephysics_](https://github.com/MathePhysics). We hail from diverse backgrounds (past students have come from Albania, Australia, China, Germany, India, Pakistan, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States) and harbor equally diverse intellectual ambitions (the involved people hold/pursue expertise in various nooks of mathematics, several corners of physics, and the many labyrinthine mazes of machine/deep learning).

Please email me at **[adogra@nyu.edu](mailto:adogra@nyu.edu)**, if you would like to see what we are all getting up to and/or wish to be involved in some way.

I have had the pleasure of formally advising/supervising the following brilliant minds:
