**A ~~brief~~ description of my research interests.**

My research interests are often rooted in applied mathematics/mathematical physics, with principled model design serving as my most well used research vehicle, and Dynamical Systems/Information Theory as my most visited topics. The versatility of their applications has led me to successful projects in machine learning, quantum information, and fluid dynamics.
